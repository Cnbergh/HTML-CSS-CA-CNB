    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[The advice would depend on the size of the client.
      
      Large corporations - with their own IT department will be able to have their own servers with firewalls, that have backup servers with redundancy and diversity on logical and physical level. They would regular push software updates and monetarized the servers. They will have more control and transparency over the application and an advise for clients like that, I would have suggested to secure passwords, frequently change them and have crypted password managers that generate passwords for the employee. Would also suggested to frequently have courses/tests for their employees to build up security knowledge. 
      
      Smaller clients would be better suited to use third party solutions, they are more affordable, runed by experts and have more scalability. I would have suggested to find a third party with good recommendation that provide cloud hosting or shared hosting with setup that use "one-site, one container" principle to prevent cross-site contamination.
      And of course suggested a strong password.]</p>
