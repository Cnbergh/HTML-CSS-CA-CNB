HTML/CSS-CA-CNB

## Brief

You need to deliver a properly functioning, responsive website for the assignment brief that you chose in Design 1 (This wuld be your Figma design).

The site needs to have every page (Scene) listed in the site architecture on your chosen brief. Certain functionality that requires JavaScript can be mimicked for now, for example a log in page could link across from the â€˜Sign in' button.

- The HTML should be semantic and neat.
- The CSS should follow the DRY principle and be easy to read.
- The website should be responsive and look good at every screen size starting from 320px with no horizontal scrollbars. Use Flexbox and CSS Grids where appropriate. Please do not use a CSS framework like Bootstrap, we want to see that you can build responsive sites without the help of a framework.
- The site should be WCAG compliant and accessibility taken into account.
- Each page should have a unique meta description, title, and h1.
- You should not use copied code in your submission. All code submitted must be written by you. You may use external sources to show you how to achieve specific effects, and these should be included in your report.
- You are allowed to use external libraries such as animation.css or open-props, but you must include quote them in your submission.

## Acceptence Criteria

- The project has a readme with a link to the live site and a link to the figma design.
- The project has an publically accessible git repository.
- The project has a live site (Can be hosted on Netlify or vercel for free).
- The project has a rationale document that explains the design decisions you made.
- Your last commit must be before your deadline.
- You may use a build tool such as Vite, Parcel but not a framework like Gatsby or Next.js.
- The project has been submitted on Moodle.

## My Summary

Ovarl I'm happy for the outcome and how it went. Have alot to learn but the site is ready for more content and I had fun.
My first close to real web-site.

Went on the same mistake as last assignment, it takes longer time then what I expect and went on to play with javascript, as was not the assignment.
Did some motification on the master Breif (https://github.com/Noroff-Education/lesson-task-htmlcss-module4-lesson4) and made a script that worked for my site.

Did not see myself using hours on placement of small iteams, but that I did!
Should have had more time.

Need to be better on spotting when and were to use grid or flex-box. Did some motifications on the design, will come back to it and explain why.
Good structure was not that easy, used alot of time and good practice to come up with a layout that suited for me.

As stated overal happy, should have had more time.

I desided to scratch the mobile version of my design and try to make the website responsive and with good flow on all sizes.
Started to set it up for 320 and upwords.

the plan was to set up a main grid and use flex-box in some of the grids.

- Still think the plan was ok, used alot of time researching and trying to learn how to use grid and flex-box better.
  The website is not 100% complete. but it is ready for more content and layout starting to look good and works good on all sizes.

Would use images tag more next time for availability access and convenience instead of background images. Discovered that out to late.

With more content I'm planing to make the menybar as my design.
